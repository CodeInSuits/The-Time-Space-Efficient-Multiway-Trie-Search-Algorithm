## Time-SpaceEfficientMultiwaytrieSearchAlgorithm
A self-designed unique multiwaytrie search algorithm that runs fast and saves space.
Plan to be written in Javascript with helps from professor Galles.

Multiway Trie data visualization involves several features such as inserting, deleting, retrieving, and searching. It follows traditional multiway trie implementation. This data structure visualization project will also be integrated into the new textbook for CSE 100 in UCSD as part of the new MOOC project I will participate in designing. 

Here are the results of its space and time cost testing:
